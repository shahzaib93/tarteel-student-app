# Ringtone Asset

Please add a ringtone file named `ringtone.mp3` to this directory.

You can:
1. Use any MP3 ringtone sound (recommended: 3-5 seconds for looping)
2. Download a free ringtone from sites like freesound.org or zapsplat.com
3. Convert any audio file to MP3 using online converters

The ringtone will play in a loop when an incoming call is received.

If no ringtone file is added, the app will still work but won't play a sound when receiving calls.
